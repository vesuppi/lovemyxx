      Shadows slowly creeping down the prairie trail
      Everything is sleeping - ah, but the nightingale
      Moon will soon be climbing in the purple sky
      Night winds all a-humming this tender lullaby.
      Cares of the day have fled
      My little sleepyhead
      Stars are in the sky
      Time that the prayers were said
      My little sleepyhead
      To a prairie lullaby
      Saddle up your pony
      The sandman's here
      To guide you down the trail of dreams
      Tumble in bed my tired
      My little sleepyhead,
      To a prairie lullaby
      Saddle up your pony
      The sandman's here
      To guide you down the trail of dreams
      Tumble in bed my tired
      My little sleepyhead
      To a prairie lullaby
