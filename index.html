      Shadows slowly creeping down the prairie trail
      Everything is sleeping - ah, but the nightingale
      Moon will soon be climbing in the purple sky
      Night winds all a-humming this tender lullaby.
      Cares of the day have fled
      My little sleepyhead
      Stars are in the sky
      Time that the prayers were said
      My little sleepyhead
      To a prairie lullaby
      Saddle up your pony
      The sandman's here
      To guide you down the trail of dreams
      Tumble in bed my tired
      My little sleepyhead,
      To a prairie lullaby
      Saddle up your pony
      The sandman's here
      To guide you down the trail of dreams
      Tumble in bed my tired
      My little sleepyhead
      To a prairie lullaby

      宝贝你知道吗？你睡觉的时候超可爱，大哥超喜欢看着宝贝睡着，总想凑上去亲我的宝贝脸蛋。
      宝贝每天早上醒来叫大哥哥，就是大哥一天最幸福的时刻。
      昨天开完会听到宝贝叫大哥哥，特别开心和惊喜，特别想抱着我宝贝、摸我宝贝头、哄我宝贝睡觉。
